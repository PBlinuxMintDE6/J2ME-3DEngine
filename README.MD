# J2ME-3D Engine
An 3D game engine designed for the Java 2 Mobile Edition platform

## Why?
I wanted to learn Java (more specifically J2ME) and though that this project would be perfect to help.
I've also always wanted to write a game engine.

## How?
The renderer takes in a set of 3D coordinates in world space and projects them onto camera space
It then further projects the camera space coordinates onto screen coordinates
A filled triangle is then drawn there.
In a few 'simple' steps, we have taken a 3D scene and rendered it. The rest is just extra.
